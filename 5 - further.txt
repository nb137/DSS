What else should you be able to do or should you try?

Branching work with git and github desktop:

GHDT:
Select Branch -> new branch
Add name of branch
Created, but only on local repository (your computer). You can do your edits now and work on your branch (for me I created one for week 2.5 [bc I had already done some of week 2 in the master])

Git:
git checkout -b <branch name>
(if branch name doesnt exist, it is created. if it does, you are now working in that branch...)
(do work on your project)
git commit -m "commit message"
git push origin <branch name> 
	
	NOT master where <branch name> because you are working on a different branch

A new branch was created. How do you get your local git to know?
git fetch origin

Hey look, a new branch was created on github. Now we can work on it by using
git checkout new-branch-name
and now our files on the local computer will look like that. if we want to work on the master files instead we can use
git checkout masteR
but master will not be automatically updated from the fetch command. we will have to push and pull


Merging branches locally with git:
You have been doing work in the branch called Week2 and you want to take all of those changes into Master to be the main work area

First, make sure your work is saved into your working branch (week2)
git branch week2
git add *
git commit -m "commit message"
git push origin week2

now lets merge master into week2 so we can see if there are conflicts while still working in the week2 branch (instead of possibly causing issues in master)
(make sure still in git branch week2)
git merge master
(look for conflicts)

now we will add the new work into master
git checkout master
git merge week2
