So I come back to my work computer from home where I've updated the master branch. But my master branch on my work computer does not contain the new file that I created...

So I hit pull, which is doing a fetch + merge where:
	Fetch = update remote branches
	Merge = merge those updates into the local repo (the files on your computer)

And so the files are now updated onto the machine you're currently working on.
