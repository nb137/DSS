git clone https://github.com/nb137/DSS.git ./folder

*do whatever work you want before you have to upload*

#now we'll say we want to upload the work we did back to the remote repository (follow the guide)

#add the files you;ve changed to the "index"
git add *	#[or git add <filename>]

#files are now staged to be uploaded to the repo

git commit -m "message about this commit"

#file is now in "head" and ready to be pushed to the remote repository

git push origin <branch>

#push your changes to the github origin, under specified branch or master
#when i did this it pushes bc i own the repo, you will (hopefully) need approval
