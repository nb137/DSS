This will be doing the same as tutorial 2 and 3, but from the command line instead of the github desktop app. The same steps will be done but with the command line, simliar to how we started the process in 1 using the command line.

It is in this order because I use command line at home and the desktop app at work, and I need to update both whenever I get to home or work and want to do work on my data.

## To be edited at home to make sure the steps work properly

We start up our computer and know that our local repo (home computer) doesn't have the freshest files from the remote repository (github)

similar to the desktop version, we need to pull our repo to our local machine

move into your working directory, for me at home I go into user/Desktop/DSfS

we can use [git pull] or ([git fetch] and then [git merge])

simply entering "git pull" works and finishes it

git pull [options] [<repository> ...]

After you've done your work you can push the changes again like in file 1. If you delete files you have to add --all to your indexing command:

git add --all
git commit -m "comment about this edit"
git push origin master
